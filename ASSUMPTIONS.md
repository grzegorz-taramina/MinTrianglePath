# Assumptions
- numbers must be integers
- if the structure of the triangle is not valid the program will return all errors that it detects
- I arbitrarily set fs2 stream buffer size to 1024. In perfect world it should be configurable. Maybe even in runtime so it doesn't require application release to experiment with other values
