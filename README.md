# MinTrianglePath

The application uses sbt-native-packager to build a native executable.

After cloning the repository, run `sbt universal:packageBin`.
It's going to create a file `target/universal/mintrianglepath-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.zip`.
Unzip the file and run `mintrianglepath-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT/bin/mintrianglepath` (or .bat for windows).
